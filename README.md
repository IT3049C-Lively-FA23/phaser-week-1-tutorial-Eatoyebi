## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

I deserve full marks.

## Self-Reflection:

I really like this assignment, I feel like I learned a lot. The tutorial was definitely very useful, I only did it, give us the steps, but it also clarified the reson behind it so that I could use what I learned and other projects. However, I did struggle with getting it to appear, I'm assuming it's because of what I had to download, so I set up a meeting with the IT learning center to figure that out, besides that it was smooth sailing.

### How long it took me to finish this?
6 hours
